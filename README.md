# Medallia DXA React Native SDK

The DXA SDK is integrated into applications to collect anonymous user data and obtain analytics for each Session.

The SDK automatically measures user behaviour within the application in real time.

The data is anonymously sent to the DXA platform for data processing.

The SDK contains an encrypted local database that is synchronised with the DXA platform.
